# ðŸ“Œ Contact Info Extractor

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This Python script scans a text file for **phone numbers, email addresses, and website URLs**, then extracts them into **separate text files** for easy access. It uses **regular expressions (regex)** to perform the extraction and **file operations** to store the results.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- âœ… **Extracts phone numbers**, email addresses, and websites from a text file.
- âœ… **Uses regex patterns** to identify and categorise contact details.
- âœ… **Saves extracted data** into separate files (`phone_numbers.txt`, `email.txt`, `websites.txt`).
- âœ… **Avoids duplicates** to ensure unique results.
- âœ… **Simple and efficient**â€”ideal for automating contact information retrieval.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Regular Expressions (`re`)** â†’ For pattern matching
- **File Handling (`open()` function)** â†’ To read input and write output

## ðŸ“œ Usage

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Copy and run the following link:
```
https://github.com/ChiomaScripts/My-Portfolio/tree/bde6e62310c82c08ba9af2d153c1dbab9659891c/Automated%20Files%20%26%20Folders%20Organiser
```

2. **Prepare the input file**
   Ensure the text file `(example_email.txt)` contains the contact information you want to extract.

3. **Run the Script**
   `python contact_info_extractor_project.py`

4. **View Extracted Data**
   The script will create and store extracted details in:
   - `phone_numbers.txt` â†’ Contains extracted phone numbers.
   - `email.txt` â†’ Contains extracted email addresses.
   - `websites.txt` â†’ Contains extracted website URLs.
  

## ðŸ›  Future Improvements
- ðŸ”¹ **Improve phone number regex** to support international formats (e.g., +44, +234).
- ðŸ”¹ **Extract social media links** in addition to websites.
- ðŸ”¹ **Improve website regex** to support websites other than those ending with `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`.
- ðŸ”¹ **Enhance error handling** to manage corrupt or missing input files.
- ðŸ”¹ **GUI interface** for easier file selection and extraction.
